# Distribution Functions

Distribution funtions are useful for identifying how atoms are ddistributed spatially, pySNOW allows for the computation of two such descriptors, the PDDF[^1] and the RDF[^2], for both of these descriptors it is also possible to evaluate such descriptors globally for all atoms or a chemical distribution function, which will isolate distribution of atoms of the same chemical species.

## PDDF

The PDDF is computed as a binning of the distances between all pairs of atoms inside the system

## RDF

The RDF 


[^1]: Pair Distance Distribution Function

[^2]: Radial Distribution Function
